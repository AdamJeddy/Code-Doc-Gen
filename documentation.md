# Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains a tool that automatically generates and updates documentation for code changes in a repository using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-4o. The tool integrates with Git to detect code changes, extract a repository overview, and update documentation. It is designed to be adaptable to any project and keeps track of updates by embedding a commit marker in the generated documentation.

## File Structure
- **.gitignore**: Contains patterns for files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **string_operations.py**: Implements string manipulation functions such as `concatenate`, `to_uppercase`, and `to_lowercase`.
- **main.py**: Entry point of the application, prints "Hello, World!".
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the Code-Doc-Gen project, setup instructions, and usage details.
- **math_operations.py**: Implements basic math operations like `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
- **file_operations.py**: Contains functions to read from and write to files.
- **langchain_github_documenter.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for setting up and using LangChain with GitHub.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- **.env**: Stores environment variables such as API keys and project settings.

## Features & Important Functions
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain to interface with GPT-4o for generating markdown documentation based on dynamic prompts.
- **Git Integration**: Uses Git commands via subprocess calls to retrieve commit logs, diffs, and to commit documentation updates. Error handling and logging are included to assist with troubleshooting.
- **Repository Overview**: The tool generates an overview of up to 10 top-level files. For text files, it includes a short snippet (up to 200 characters) to help contextualize the purpose of each file.
- **Extensibility**: The modular design allows you to easily extend or customize the tool to suit different project needs or integrate with additional systems.
